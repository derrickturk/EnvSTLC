A simply-typed lambda calculus with integers, booleans, let-expressions,
and named toplevel bindings.

Built to experiment with doubly-indirect "locally nameless" representations as seen in the interpreter for the PiSigma language as seen [here](https://github.com/zlizta/PiSigma), [here](https://github.com/zlizta/pisigma-0-2-2), or in my buildable forks [here](https://github.com/derrickturk/PiSigma) and [here](https://github.com/derrickturk/pisigma-0-2-2).

The REPL produces a lot of "garbage" to allow for watching the environment grow as toplevel declarations and definitions are added and new terms are evaluated.

Grammar and details to follow soon...
